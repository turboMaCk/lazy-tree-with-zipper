# Performance

I've implemented the same feature within one of our application using
[tomjkidd/elm-multiway-tree-zipper](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/tomjkidd/elm-multiway-tree-zipper/latest)
and this package and profiled performance with real production data.

Application fetch data from two endpoints and then builds a Tree from them. The total number of nodes within resulting three is 4278.

## Conclusion

For large trees where it's not necessary to evaluate whole structure at once lazy tree is definitelly much more performant.
However if you're working with much smaller data strict version like `tomjkidd/elm-multiway-tree-zipper` should be fine.
